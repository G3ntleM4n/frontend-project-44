### Description
Brain Games is a collection of games that can be played in the console.
In each game, the user must win three rounds. If the player fails, the game ends.
The collection contains 5 games:
1. **Brain-even**. In this game, it is necessary to answer whether the number given to the player is even.
2. **Brain-calc**. The player needs to correctly specify the result of given mathematical operation.
3. **Brain-gcd**. The player must calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
4. **Brain-progression**. The player is faced with a progression of numbers with one missing number.
5. **Brain-prime**. In this game, it is necessary to specify whether the natural number given to the player is prime.
